# Convex-Hull-Algorithm
This repository contains both sequential and parallel implementation of the Convex Hull problem in computational geometry. C++11 threads have been used in the parallel implementation and two different methods for tangent computation have been implemented - one is the Walking Method and the other suggested by Leeuwen.
